# UnityGame

These are the scripts used in the unity game that was previewed on youtube. the Unity game folder was not entirely uploaded but rather the scripts used in the development of the game, as these show more of my programming skills.

The game engine was based on a state machine in order to run, and for the robot to keep track of the states it is in. At the occurence of an error, the robot can revert back to a state and resume therapy
