# UnityGame

These are the scripts used in the unity game. the Unity game folder was not entirely uploaded but rather the scripts used in the development of the game, as these show more of my programming skills.

The game engine was run on a state machine, in order for the robot to keep track of the state it is in. At the occurence of an error, the robot can revert back to a state and resume therapy

The game is built-in with numerous fail safe measures along the way, since the patient undergoing therapy has limited mobility (due to stroke), and we cannot afford to have the system malfunction.
